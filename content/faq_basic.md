### How do I use my Benefits Card?

Present your card to your Health Care Provider or Pharmacist for them to access the electronic pay-direct system. Using your card allows for immediate claims processing without the need for you or your Health Care Provider to mail in a claim form. Your Provider will let you know if there is any amount owing.

## How do I submit a disability claim?

**FIRST**… You must apply to all other sources from which you may be entitled to receive benefits.

These sources include:

* WCB/WSIB (if disability is a work related illness/injury)
* Automotive insurance company (if disability is a vehicle related injury)
**SECOND**… You must apply for Sick Benefits from Employment Insurance (“E.I.”) at the same time that you make an application for benefits from the Benefit Plan. This is done each time you make a claim, because the payments from the Benefit Plan are coordinated with E.I.

**THIRD**… You must complete and submit to us, within 90 days from your FIRST DAY OF ABSENCE, the enclosed Claimant’s Statement (Form 1), along with the Agreement to Reimburse.

**FOURTH**… Take the Attending Physician’s Statement (Form 3A) to your physician. Ask your physician to complete the form and mail it to us as soon as possible.

**If your disability is related to a Mental Health Condition, you must be under the care of a Psychiatrist licensed to practice in your province of residence.**

**Complete a Major Medical claim form and attach your receipt for completion of the medical form and forward the forms to the Administrator.**

**FIFTH**… If your forms are correctly completed and you qualify for benefits, the amount of your benefit will be processed and a payment will be made to you within one week. This process may be delayed if further information is required from your doctor.

Here is how the co-ordination with E.I. works:

1. The Benefit Plan will pay you up to the date E.I. benefits start.

2. E.I. will pay you for up to this next 26 weeks. Written proof of the date your E.I. started and ended must be sent to the Administrator

3. If you are still disabled, the Benefit Plan will pay you for the balance of the “Maximum Benefit Period” provided you are medically approved.

The “Maximum Benefit Period” (including E.I.) depends on your years of service with Maple Leaf Foods Inc.:

Years of Service Benefit Period

Less than 5 years: Up to 26 weeks

5 years but less than 10 years: Up to 39 weeks

10 years and longer: Up to 52 weeks

**It is your responsibility to ensure that all forms are fully completed and returned to the Administrator as soon as possible. Any missing information may delay the processing of your claim.**

### Can claims be paid directly to my provider?

If your Health Care Provider is not currently set up to do so, let PBAS know by submitting a Health Provider contact form on the Public Website or by emailing their contact information to mapleleaf@pbas.ca. Alternatively, you could direct your Health Care Provider to the website for them to submit themselves.

### How do I sign up for Direct Deposit?

You can take advantage of direct deposit for your claim reimbursements once you have registered as a Member on the UFCW Union/Maple Leaf Foods Inc. Benefits Plan Portal or website and have updated your profile. You will begin to receive reimbursements by direct deposit 2-3 business days after you submit your request.

To make this process simple, have a blank cheque or direct deposit form from your bank on hand when you register. These documents include all the information required to set up direct deposit. Your payments can be deposited into a chequing or savings account. If you have another kind of account, please call your financial institution to find out what accounts you can use for direct deposit. Alternatively, you can complete the Direct Deposit form on the Public Website and submit it to PBAS either electronically or by mail.

You can change your direct deposit at any time by updating your information under your profile. To remove your direct deposit information, please contact PBAS.

Before the payment has been deposited into your account, you will receive an email detailing the payment. This is called an Explanation of Benefits. With normal bank clearing procedures, your payment should be deposited within 2-3 business days.

### How do Co-ordinate Benefits with another plan (COB)?

If you are eligible for coverage under your spouse's benefit plan or an alternative plan, the primary benefit plan for you will be this Plan. You can co-ordinate this Plan with another benefit plan to receive maximum coverage.

To do this, you must:

* Submit the claim to your primary benefit plan
* Submit the unpaid portion to the secondary benefit plan, including a copy of the Explanation of Benefit (EOB) and a copy of the original claim form.

**NOTE**: If your spouse has their own benefit plan, then this Plan will be their secondary plan.

If your children are covered under both benefit plans, then please first submit your child's claims to the plan of the parent whose birth month falls earliest in the year (regardless of year of birth). Once the claim is processed, any unpaid portion showing on the related Explanation of Benefits that accompanies the claim reimbursement is, then, submitted to the other parent's benefit plan for processing.

### How do I know when my benefit maximums have been reached?

You can view any remaining coverage under Benefit Balance in the UFCW Union/Maple Leaf Foods Inc. Benefits Plan Portal.

### Can I view my claims payments on the Plan Portal?

With the launch of the UFCW Union/Maple Leaf Foods Inc. Benefits Plan Portal, all claims paid from launch onwards will display daily so that you always have the most current information about your submitted claims. You will find Claim History information under the Claims section of the UFCW Union/Maple Leaf Foods Inc. Benefits Plan Portal.

You have the option to print or download the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) for any claim that you have submitted. This document details the claim information and reimbursement issued according to your Plan rules. This information is useful if you must submit it to another insurance plan or for income tax purposes.
