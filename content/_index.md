The UFCW Union/Maple Leaf Foods Inc. Benefit Plan was established for the purpose of providing, from the assets of the Trust Fund, health and wellness benefits for Eligible Employees.

The Plan is financed through a requirement in your Union Collective Bargaining Agreement that your employer pays a negotiated amount into the Plan for every hour you work. The only costs Plan Participants are responsible for are those charges that exceed coverage provided by the Plan.
